## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’ve been learning programming for nearly two years through self-study and hands-on practice.
From the beginning, I focused on **thinking like a programmer** rather than memorizing syntax.

I’m comfortable turning ideas into working applications.
When I encounter unfamiliar technologies or syntax, I learn them during implementation,
using AI tools as learning accelerators while maintaining a clear understanding of the code I write.

I primarily work on Linux and care deeply about clean, maintainable, and well-structured code.
